# HotelBookingSystem
This is a project made with basic Java knowledge, so expect lots of bugs :)

-- There are no cancelling options

-- Respond with Yes to create a booking/No to exit the system

-- Let me know if there are any bugs, I am quite new to working on projects like these

-- You can play around with the code and add more objects to the classes

-- Thats pretty much it :D

-- This is by no means a complete system, just a project made for fun
